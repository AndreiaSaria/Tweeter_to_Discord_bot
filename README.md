# Twitter_to_Discord_bot
Work in progress!

A Discord bot made in Python that gets information from twitter and transfers it to a Discord server.
I'm using Replit and UptimeBot to keep it alive.

Add a twitter user to follow in streaming and every post will be sent to a chosen discord channel.
There are also some functions:

Search twitter for a specific subject/user/hashtag
--public_tweet_about <Consider RT's? True/False> <"subject you want to seach">
