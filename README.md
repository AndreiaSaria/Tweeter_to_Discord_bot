# Twitter_to_Discord_bot
Work in progress!

A Discord bot made in Python that gets information from twitter and transfers it to a Discord server.
It also gets random dogs for you and plays youtube audio!
I'm using Replit and UptimeBot to keep it alive.

Add a twitter user to follow in streaming and every post will be sent to a chosen discord channel.
In line 48 you can add your own twitter to follow.

There are also some functions:

Search twitter for a specific subject/user/hashtag. It only works if you have the minimum role.
--public_tweet_about <Consider RT's? True/False> <"subject you want to seach">

Get dogs from random.dog
--dog

Play youtube audio 
--play <URL>
  
Pause audio
--pause
  
Resume
--resume
  
Leave voice channel
--leave
